#My magnum opus

AeliusGuides is a website which will or does contain useful guides on how to do various things ranging from _ to _.

This is a collection of things I've learned how to do over my time doing things in general. Some things may be left off _intentionally_ because someone else has done it better or I think it's obvious.

Each guide contains a main article, a simple list of to-dos and some extra items if I believe they're necessary. 

A different version of the guide (which can be used in your favorite markdown compatible text viewing software) is available in this repository.
