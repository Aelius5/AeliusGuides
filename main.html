    Hello, and welcome to AeliusGuides!

    This website will contain useful guides on how to do various things ranging from [[]] to [[]] (both of which exist on this website!) 

    This is a collection of things I've learned how to do over my time doing things in general. Some things may be left off _intentionally_ because someone else has done it better or I think it's obvious.

    Each guide contains a main article, a simple list of to-dos and some extra items if I believe they're necessary. 

    A different version of the guide (which can be used in your favorite markdown compatible text viewing software) is available here.


    Below is a list of all the currently available guides. By default, they're sorted into groups, but other sorting options exist. The search bar searches for keywords, names, and groups.
