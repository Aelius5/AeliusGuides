    Hello, and welcome to AeliusGuides!<br>
    <br>
    This website will contain useful guides on how to do various things ranging from version numbering to _.<br>
    <br>
    This is a collection of things I've learned how to do over my time doing things in general. Some things may be left off <italic>intentionally</italic> because someone else has done it better or I think it's obvious.<br>
    <br>
    Each guide contains a main article, a simple list of to-dos and some extra items if I believe they're necessary. <br>
    <br>
    A different version of the guide (which can be used in your favorite markdown compatible text viewing software) is available here.<br>
    <br><br>
    Below is a list of all the currently available guides. By default, they're sorted into groups, but other sorting options exist. The search bar searches for names and groups.
